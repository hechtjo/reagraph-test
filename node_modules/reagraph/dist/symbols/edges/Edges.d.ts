/**
 * Three.js rendering starts to get slower if you have an individual mesh for each edge
 * and a high number of edges.
 *
 * Instead, we take the edges and split them into their different render states:
 *
 *  * - Active (any edges that are marked as "selected" or "active" in the state)
 *  * - Dragging (any edges that are connected to a node that is being dragged)
 *  * - Intersecting (any edges that are currently intersected by the ray from the mouse position)
 *  * - Inactive (any edges that aren't active, dragging, or intersected)
 *
 * We generate the geometry for each edge in each of these groups, and then merge them
 * into a single geometry for each group. This merged mesh is rendered as one object
 * which gives much better performance. This means that we only need to update geometry
 * and positions when edges move between the different states, rather than updating all
 * edges whenever any other edge changes.
 *
 * To get this all working, we have to do a few things outside the @react-three/fiber world,
 * specifically:
 *
 *  * manually create edge/arrow geometries (see `useEdgeGeometry`)
 *  * manually track mouse/edge interactions and fire events (see `useEdgeEvents`)
 *  * manually update edge/arrow positions during aniamations (see `useEdgeAnimations`)
